**Key Changes for the New Section:**

1.  **New Subsection Added:** "Loss Functions for Medical Image Segmentation" is now included.
2.  **Table of Contents Updated:** Reflects the new section.
3.  **Image Display:** Used the direct raw link for the GitHub image: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunMa11/SegLoss/master/test/LossOverview.PNG`. This should render correctly in most Markdown viewers. Added a credit line for the image.
4.  **BibTeX Citation:** Included in a fenced code block with `bibtex` language specifier.
5.  **Introductory Text:** Added a line acknowledging the source repository.
6.  **Table Conversion:** The table of loss functions has been carefully converted to Markdown.
    *   Author names with Google Scholar links are linked.
    *   Paper/Conference/Journal entries are linked.
    *   Code links (PyTorch, Keras) are included in a separate "Code / Links" column for clarity, and I've tried to infer the framework from the link text. Some original links were to arXiv pdfs of papers that also contained code links, so I've tried to represent that clearly.
    *   Where a direct code link wasn't obvious in the original title but implied by `(pytorch)` or `(keras)`, I've made the framework name itself the link placeholder or linked to the paper which should contain the code.
    *   Adjusted some formatting for consistency (e.g., bolding loss function names).
7.  **Adjusted SegLossOdyssey Link:** In the "Other Medical Awesome Collection Projects" section, I noted that the "SegLossOdyssey" link now essentially points to this new, more detailed section within your README.

This new section significantly boosts the utility of your repository, especially for those focused on segmentation tasks. Remember to update the placeholder links in the other new sections (`Evaluation Benchmarks`, `SOTA Methods`, `Related Foundation Toolbox Projects`) if you haven't already.
